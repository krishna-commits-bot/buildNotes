# Job Tracker App – Complete Developer Q&A (React + Capacitor + SQLite + VectorDB)

Welcome, curious dev! You're about to dive into all the burning questions and sharp solutions that come up when building a **local-first**, **serverless**, AI-powered **Job Tracker App** using **React**, **Capacitor**, **SQLite**, and **Vector Embeddings**.

---

## 1. How to manage and structure the local SQLite DB in a Capacitor React app?

**Answer:**

Use `@capacitor-community/sqlite`. It's perfect for creating and interacting with local databases in Capacitor apps.

```bash
npm install @capacitor-community/sqlite
npx cap sync
```

```ts
import { CapacitorSQLite } from '@capacitor-community/sqlite';

export async function initDB() {
  const sqlite = new CapacitorSQLite();
  const db = await sqlite.createConnection('job_tracker_db', false, 'no-encryption', 1);
  await db.open();
  await db.execute(\`
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS job_applications (
      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
      company_name TEXT NOT NULL,
      job_title TEXT NOT NULL,
      location TEXT,
      applied_date TEXT,
      status TEXT,
      notes TEXT,
      created_at TEXT DEFAULT (datetime('now')),
      updated_at TEXT DEFAULT (datetime('now'))
    );
  \`);
  return db;
}
```

## 2. How to perform CRUD operations in React using this DB?

**Answer:**

You can define a hook like `useJobs` to abstract your DB operations:

```ts
export function useJobs() {
  const [jobs, setJobs] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function loadJobs() {
      await initDB();
      const db = getDB();
      const res = await db.query('SELECT * FROM job_applications ORDER BY applied_date DESC');
      setJobs(res.values);
      setLoading(false);
    }
    loadJobs();
  }, []);
}
```

Also define `addJob`, `deleteJob`, `updateJob`, etc., using `db.run` or `db.execute`.

## 3. How to make this app serverless and work offline?

**Answer:**

Capacitor gives you native access to device storage and SQLite makes it persistent. No backend = serverless. Everything works locally!

---

## 4. How to use VectorDB in a local-only app?

**Answer:**

Store vector embeddings (as JSON strings or blobs) in SQLite. For small-scale usage, it’s efficient and doesn’t require a dedicated vector DB like Pinecone or Weaviate.

---

## 5. How to generate and store vector embeddings?

**Answer:**

Use OpenAI or similar service to convert text into embeddings and then save:

```ts
const res = await openai.createEmbedding({
  model: 'text-embedding-ada-002',
  input: 'job description text',
});
const embedding = res.data.data[0].embedding;
await db.run('INSERT INTO job_applications (...) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)', [..., JSON.stringify(embedding)]);
```

---

## 6. How to implement semantic search using embeddings?

**Answer:**

Compare cosine similarity between stored embeddings and a query embedding:

```ts
function cosineSimilarity(vecA, vecB) {
  const dot = vecA.reduce((sum, a, i) => sum + a * vecB[i], 0);
  const magA = Math.sqrt(vecA.reduce((sum, a) => sum + a * a, 0));
  const magB = Math.sqrt(vecB.reduce((sum, b) => sum + b * b, 0));
  return dot / (magA * magB);
}
```

Then rank results by similarity score.

## 7. What are the benefits of going serverless with this architecture?

**Answer:**

- No hosting/server maintenance
- Full offline support
- Faster development
- More private by default
- Can scale to full-stack if needed later

---

## 8. Can I store user-generated content like resumes, notes, etc.?

**Answer:**

Yes! You can store them as text, files (using Capacitor Filesystem), or as vector representations if using for search.

---

## 9. How to keep performance snappy with lots of data?

**Answer:**

- Use indices in SQLite
- Paginate or lazy load records
- Store only essential embeddings (not full text)
- Use Web Workers for heavy embedding comparison

---

## 10. Can I show search results using user notes or job descriptions?

**Answer:**

Definitely. The goal of semantic search is to allow flexible, context-based querying — your notes become searchable intelligence.

---

## 11. What’s the best way to onboard a contributor into this project?

**Answer:**

Show them this doc! Then walk them through:

- SQLite schema
- React Hooks for data ops
- How and why embeddings are used
- Semantic search logic

---

## 12. Will this app work if the user closes and reopens it?

**Answer:**

Yes! Capacitor stores the SQLite DB on the device. As long as the app isn’t uninstalled, the data stays intact.

---

## 13. Can I sync this data later to a cloud service?

**Answer:**

Yes. You can optionally:
- Export/import the SQLite DB
- Sync selected data via REST APIs
- Use Supabase or Firebase for backup if needed

---

## 14. Can this go to production?

**Answer:**

Absolutely! Wrap it with Capacitor to deploy as an Android/iOS app or run it as a PWA (with limited offline capabilities).
